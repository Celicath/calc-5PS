# Five Pieces
Five pieces is a RPG made with FX-9860G SDK back in 2007-2008.

## Gameplay
Since this game is pretty old and made when I was playing this with my real life friends, controls are usually not explained in-game and some of them might feel strange.
I'll explain some controls here.

* [EXE]: 'Confirm' key.
* Directional keys: Move cursor, character, etc.
* [MENU]: Opens in-game menu if you're in the 'Field'. Does not work while in combat.
* [AC]: Save & Quit when you're in the 'Field'. Does not work while in combat.

You can press [SHIFT]-[AC] to turn off your calculator or [MENU] to go back to main menu of the calculator ONLY when you're in the title & data screen.

From the title screen, select 'Game Start'. Then select any data, and enter password(numbers).

Then, you will enter your name. Using [SHIFT]-[ALPHA] will activate A-LOCK mode. [DEL] key only deletes the character in the current position; it does not 'backspace'.

### Field

You can move using directional keys. If you move to the right side, you'll move to next Place.

Place number multiples of 4 are 'towns'. You can visit Shop, Rest, and do some other stuff.

Enemies are encountered randomly while not in the towns. You'll encounter boss enemies when you move next to some single-letters.

### Combat

It's strangely called 'Row-battle Fight'.

Combat is turn-based. Press [F1] to attack the enemy, and the enemy will attack you.

As you level up, you'll learn skills which can be used by pressing [F2]-skill number(the number pad keys). The only skills available are buffs and debuffs.

## Legacy
Damage is exponential to stats, which seemed cool at the time but it's too hard to balance.
Also, there are not many contents beside grinding, so you may consider this as a battle simulator.
